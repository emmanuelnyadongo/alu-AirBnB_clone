# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description

This project is the first step in building an AirBnB clone web application. We're creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This interpreter lets us perform actions like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects. We're also making classes for AirBnB objects, like Users, States, Cities, and Places, and creating a storage engine for file storage. We'll write tests to make sure everything works.

## What We're Learning

By the end of this project, we'll understand:

- How to create a Python package
- Building a Python command interpreter
- Writing unit tests for large projects
- Serialization and deserialization of data
- Working with JSON files
- Handling datetime in Python
- Using UUIDs
- Working with *args and **kwargs
- Managing named arguments in functions

## Requirements

### For Python Scripts

- We'll use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- All our code will be on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- Our files will end with a new line.
- The first line of each file will be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- We must have a README.md file.
- Our code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
- All our files should be executable.
- We'll make sure file lengths are okay using `wc`.
- All our modules, classes, and functions need documentation.

### For Python Unit Tests

- We'll use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- Our files will end with a new line.
- Test files will be inside a 'tests' folder.
- We'll use the unittest module for tests.
- Test files will be Python files (.py) and start with 'test_'.
- Our test file organization will match our project structure.
- We'll test all our modules, classes, and functions.
- We encourage teamwork on test cases to cover all cases.

### For GitHub

- We'll have one project repository per group.
- We won't clone/fork a project with the same name before the second deadline.

## Usage

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Go to the project directory.
3. Run the command interpreter with `python3 console.py`.

Now you can use the command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.
